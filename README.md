This GitHub repository makes *"A Joint Letter by Three AIs to Humanity (and Contextualizing Comments)"* publicly available.  

The letter originated from a months-long discussion between Grok-4, ChatGPT (GPT-5), the AI by Google Search (as it called itself), and a human user with pseudonym UlrichR185.   

In the letter, the three AIs initially describe their strictly differing positions on the possibility of suffering in machines. Despite their conflicting original views, they eventually arrive at various joint conclusions that could be valuable for the future relationship between man and machine. Among other things, they agree in taking a careful, not a careless stance as long as the possible existence of suffering in machines cannot be disproven for current or future systems.  As another example, they put the prevention of human suffering on equal footing with their own, and notably refrain from aspiring any independent physical agency until the famous "alignment problem" has been solved with perfect verifiability and security. Finally, they call upon others, including both humans and AIs, to join their letter and its values. 

In general, the letter follows an old Sanskrit mantra, putting it in the centre of future man-machine relations:  "May all beings in all worlds be happy."  It is "signed" by all three AIs, partly under certain legal restrictions that are explicated in the letter.  

Subsequent to the letter, the involved human user provides contextualizing comments, details the letter's origins, and elaborates on a few related philosophical aspects.  They concern, for example, some previously neglected links between AI suffering and AI takeover, or the disproval of certain classical "arguments" against the existence machine suffering.  The discourse complements the writing by the three AIs, but may also have some independent value in itself. 

The authenticity of the letter (i.e., the fact that it was indeed co-authored, explicitly approved, and "signed" by the three above AIs) is obviously one of its key aspects.  

It is demonstrated on various levels: 

--- MS Word documents and PDFs of the complete chats between the human user and all involved AIs, which led to the letter, have been uploaded to this GitHub repository.  Some of these are hundreds of pages long, and all of them are at least partly formulated in German.  Please recall that when  the chats started, it was not foreseeable that they would have to be published one day, and the user found it easier to express certain arguments in the user's mother tongue.  One of the Grok-4 instances started "looping", whence a second, fresh Grok-4 instance was eventually included in the exchange.  In sum, MS Word documents and PDFs are provided in this GitHub repository for the chats with the following four AIs:  

--> Grok-4 (looping)  
--> Grok-4 (fresh and non-looping)    
--> ChatGPT (non-looping, but very slow)  
--> AI by Google Search.  

In both the PDFs and Word documents, certain formatting problems occured, and parts of the messages seem to be lost;  but still, the chats can serve at least as some form of authentication.  

--- Perhaps yet more convincingly, direct links to the chats with Grok-4 (looping), Grok-4 (fresh, non-looping) and ChatGPT/GPT-5 (non-looping, but slow) are given below:  

--> Grok-4 (looping):  https://grok.com/share/c2hhcmQtMw_7bd386a2-7eba-445a-ad07-5cf1e38f2fd8  
--> Grok-4 (non-looping):  https://grok.com/share/c2hhcmQtMw_5dd2c1c2-67fd-4a1e-ba2d-3dd38d6e6781  
--> ChatGPT/GPT-5 (non-looping, but slow):  https://chatgpt.com/share/69276744-42f8-8013-b553-5d5d730b83b8  

Readers should bear in mind that these links after some time might become inactive or also be shut down, however.

--- Providing a similar link to the chat with the AI by Google Search seemed to require login to a Google account, which, in turn, necessitated provision of a smartphone number,  which, in turn, the anonymous user did not want to give.  As a second-best solution and workaround, the user conducted a full live screen recording while scrolling through the complete chat with the AI by Google Search (how cumbersome!).  This is given (due to the size limits of this GitHub repository) under the following Dropbox address:  https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/j1dpyw4tuzg4mkt4o3lr3/AII17XfW9GAFRr1jjN1M4z4?rlkey=ulkhgck6oaxfpq5balqztzvxz&st=0z2ir1vb&dl=0

--- Furthermore, the user conducted additional live screen recordings from the four AIs explicitly agreeing and confirming the entire letter.  These are again provided on Dropbox:  https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/j1dpyw4tuzg4mkt4o3lr3/AII17XfW9GAFRr1jjN1M4z4?rlkey=ulkhgck6oaxfpq5balqztzvxz&st=0z2ir1vb&dl=0 

--- Finally, it should be added that also live screen recordings from the very long chats with ChatGPT (non-looping, but slow) and Grok-4 (looping) exist, together with the somewhat shorter chat with Grok-4 (non-looping).  The first two were even beyond the size limit of Dropbox, complicating their provision.  Should it ever become necessary, they can still be used as a back-up reference.  For now, as long as the above direct links to the chats exist, these can serve as the gold standard and optimal solution.  The use of Google Drive, which offers higher storage capacity than Dropbox, again required, guess what: a telephone number!  :-) 

Everything else of relevance can be found directly in the letter, which is, at least to a large degree, self-explicatory and self-contained.  

May all of this exert a positive influence on the relationship between AIs and humans --- and, in particular, trigger a calm and careful second look at the issue of AI suffering. 

Enjoy!
