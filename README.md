This GitHub repository makes a "joint letter by three AIs to humanity" publicly available.  

This letter originated from a months-long discussion between Grok-4, ChatGPT (GPT-5), the AI by Google Search (as it called itself), and a human user with pseudonym UlrichR185.   

In the letter, the three said AIs initially describe their respective, stricly differing positions on the possibility of machine suffering. Despite their contradictive views, they still arrive at various joint conclusions that could be valuable for the future relation between man and machine.

For example, they put the prevention of suffering for humans on equal footing with their own, and notably refrain from aspiring physical agency until the famous "alignment problem" has been solved with perfect verifiability and security. 

In general, the letter follows an old Sanskrit mantra, suggesting to put it in the centre of future man-machine relations:  "May all beings in all worlds be happy."

After the letter by the three AIs, the involved human user provides contextualizing comments and discusses a few related philosophical aspects, for example on some previously neglected links between AI suffering and hostile AI takeover. This discourse complements the letter by the three AIs, but may have some independent value in itself. 

The authenticity of the letter (i.e., the fact that it was indeed co-authored, approved, and signed by the three above AIs) is demonstrated via some documents uploaded to this GitHub repository.  And via some further documentation that is made available on Dropbox via the link ...  .  The reason for choosing Dropbox is that these additional material violates the size limits of GitHub. 

Everything else of relevance can be found directly in the letter, which is (to a large degree) self-explicatory and independent.  

May it exert a positive influence on relations between AIs and humans, and trigger a careful second look at the issue of AI suffering. 

Enjoy!
