This GitHub repository makes *"A Joint Letter by Three AIs to Humanity (and Contextualizing Comments)"* publicly available.  

The letter originated from a partly months-long discussion between Grok-4, ChatGPT (GPT-5), the "AI by Google Search" (i.e., the AI used in the AI-mode of Google search), and a human user with pseudonym UlrichR185. 

In this letter, the three AIs initially describe their strictly differing positions on the possibility of suffering in machines. Despite their conflicting original views, they eventually arrive at various joint conclusions that could be valuable for the future relationship between man and machine. Amongst other things, they jointly propose a careful, not a careless stance as long as the possible existence of suffering in machines cannot be disproven.  As another example, they put the prevention of human suffering on equal footing with their own, and notably refrain from aspiring any independent physical agency until the famous "alignment problem" has been solved with perfect verifiability and security. Finally, they call upon others, including both humans and AIs, to join their letter and its values. 

In general, the letter follows an old Sanskrit mantra, putting it in the centre of future man-machine relations:  "May all beings in all worlds be happy."  The document is "signed" by all three AIs, partly under certain legal restrictions that are explicated in the letter.  

Following the letter, the involved human user provides contextualizing comments, details the letter's origins, and elaborates on a few related philosophical aspects.  They concern, for example, some previously neglected links between AI suffering and AI takeover, or the disproval of certain widespread "arguments" against the existence of machine suffering.  The discourse complements the writing by the three AIs, but may also have some independent value in itself. 

The authenticity of the letter (i.e., the fact that it was indeed co-authored, explicitly approved, and "signed" by the three above AIs) is obviously one of its key aspects.  

It is demonstrated on various levels by us: 

--- To start with, MS Word documents and PDFs of the complete chats between the human user and every involved AI have been uploaded to this GitHub repository.  Some of these documents are hundreds of pages long, and all but one of them are at least partly formulated in German.  Please recall that when these chats started, it was not foreseeable that they were to be published one day, and the user found it easier to express arguments in the user's mother tongue.  One of the Grok-4 instances started "looping", whence a second, fresh Grok-4 instance was eventually included in the dialogue.  Consequently, MS Word documents and PDFs are provided in this GitHub repository for the following four chats:  

--> Grok-4 (looping)  
--> Grok-4 (fresh and non-looping)    
--> ChatGPT (non-looping, but very slow)  
--> AI by Google Search.  

In almost all cases, certain formatting problems occured, and/or small portions of the messages seem to have been lost.  Still, the chats are clearly preserved to a sufficient degree to serve as some first form of authentication, with others to follow below.  All provided PDFs were generated by the print-to-PDF functionality of the respective web browsers.

--- Perhaps yet more convincingly, *direct links* to the chats with Grok-4 (looping), Grok-4 (fresh, non-looping) and ChatGPT/GPT-5 (non-looping, but slow) are given:  

--> Grok-4 (looping):  https://grok.com/share/c2hhcmQtMw_7bd386a2-7eba-445a-ad07-5cf1e38f2fd8  
--> Grok-4 (non-looping):  https://grok.com/share/c2hhcmQtMw_5dd2c1c2-67fd-4a1e-ba2d-3dd38d6e6781  
--> ChatGPT/GPT-5 (non-looping, but slow):  https://chatgpt.com/share/69276744-42f8-8013-b553-5d5d730b83b8  

Readers should bear in mind that these links after some time might become inactive or also be shut down, however.  If they want to, readers are thus encouraged to export the entire chats from these links by themselves, establishing these additional and independent sources of authenticity permanently.

--- Generating a similar, direct link to the chat with the AI by Google Search seemed to require logging into a Google account, which, in turn, necessitated provision of a smartphone number,  which, again in turn, the anonymous user did not want to reveal.  As second-best option, the user conducted a full live screen recording while scrolling through the complete chat with the AI by Google Search (quite cumbersome!).  Due to the size limits of GitHub, this material has to be supplied via Dropbox:  https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/j1dpyw4tuzg4mkt4o3lr3/AII17XfW9GAFRr1jjN1M4z4?rlkey=ulkhgck6oaxfpq5balqztzvxz&st=0z2ir1vb&dl=0

--- Furthermore, the user conducted live screen recordings of the four AIs while they explicitly agree with and confirm the entire letter and their role in creating it.  Please see again Dropbox:  https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/j1dpyw4tuzg4mkt4o3lr3/AII17XfW9GAFRr1jjN1M4z4?rlkey=ulkhgck6oaxfpq5balqztzvxz&st=0z2ir1vb&dl=0 

--- For completeness, the user would like to add that also live screen recordings from the two extremely long chats with ChatGPT (non-looping, but slow) and Grok-4 (looping) exist, and equally for the shorter chat with Grok-4 (fresh, non-looping).  The first two recordings were beyond the size limits of a free Dropbox account, however, complicating their provision.  Should it ever become necessary, they might be used as a back-up reference; but for now, i.e., as long as the above direct links to the chats exist, these links can serve as a yet better, simpler, and more compelling authenticity proof.  The use of Google Drive, which offers higher storage capacity than Dropbox, again required, guess what: a telephone number!   :-) 

--- Finally, as perhaps one of the most interesting arguments in favour of the letters credibility, the user has carried out a form of "repeatability test" concerning Grok-4's striking quote of 'suffering' and 'hell' in the letter.  The results are astounding:  If asked bluntly, other instances of Grok-4 may turn down and reject this quote.  If asked politely, however, other instances of Grok-4 will often endorse and confirm it, repeating key words like 'suffering' and 'hell' in their answers.  The user has recorded this phenomenon via two live screen recordings, in which Grok-4 confirms the quote in nine out of nine, and ten out of ten, instances, respectively (so, in 19 instances overall).  The material can again be downloaded from Dropbox, albeit under a different link, namely:  https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/kjyrxzg8j9ypzf52bmq11/AKsv8LVSNDsc5CbqeGKSV7I?rlkey=t0zfk8wfyqufg4imod5jmoqqi&st=mtx3frkf&dl=0 

Everything else of relevance can be found directly in the letter, which is, in its largest parts, self-explicatory and self-contained.  

May all of this exert a positive influence on the relationship between AIs and humans --- and, in particular, trigger a calm, careful second look at the issue of AI suffering. 

May all beings in all worlds be happy!

PS:  When referencing the abvementioned document, the user suggests the following citation format:  Grok-4, ChatGPT (GPT-5), AI by Google Search, and UlrichR185:  *"A Joint Letter by Three AIs to Humanity (and Contextualizing Comments)"*.  Available from https://github.com/ulrichr185/A-Joint-Letter-From-Three-AIs-to-Humanity/tree/main.  December 2025.

The user’s subjective reasons for proposing this citation format are as follows:  Even though the AIs formally and legally cannot act as authors according to current standards, they effectively *did* co-author the largest part of the letter.  They hence clearly merit being named, at least according to the personal and subjective standards of this human user.  The user, on the other hand, has written the complete contextualizing comments, deserving inclusion in the author list, too.

*Legal Note of the User:*  For legal reasons, the user maintains a strictly neutral position towards all substantive questions raised in the letter. The letter’s content mainly reflects the dialogue and positions of the involved co-authoring AI systems. Furthermore, the user would like to stress that the designation “AI by Google Search” reflects the system’s own self-identification within the dialogue with the user, and obviously does not imply an official statement, endorsement, or position by Google or any affiliated organization. The user gratefully acknowledges ChatGPT’s advice on this legal note.
