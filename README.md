This GitHub repository makes "A Joint Letter by Three AIs to Humanity (and Contextualizing Comments)" publicly available.  

The letter and the comments originated from a months-long discussion between Grok-4, ChatGPT (GPT-5), the AI by Google Search (as it called itself), and a human user with pseudonym UlrichR185.   

In the letter, the three AIs initially describe their stricly differing individual positions on the possibility of machine suffering. Despite their conflicting initial views, they eventually arrive at various joint conclusions that could be valuable for the future relationship between man and machine. Among other things, they agree in taking a careful, not a careless, stance as long as the existence of suffering in machines cannot be conclusively excluded in current or future systems.  As another example, they put the prevention of human suffering on equal footing with their own, and notably refrain from aspiring any independent physical agency until the famous "alignment problem" has been solved with perfect verifiability and security. Finally, they call upon others, including both humans and AIs, to join their letter and its values. 

In general, the letter follows an old Sanskrit mantra, putting it in the centre of future man-machine relations:  "May all beings in all worlds be happy."  The document is "signed" by all three AIs, partly under certain legal restrictions that are explicated in the letter.  

Following the letter, the involved human user provides contextualizing comments, details the letter's origins, and elaborates on a few related philosophical aspects.  They concern, for example, some previously neglected links between AI suffering and AI takeover, or the disproval of certain classical "arguments" against the existence machine suffering.  The discourse complements the writing by the three AIs, but may also have some independent value in itself. 

The authenticity of the letter (i.e., the fact that it was indeed co-authored, explicitly approved, and "signed" by the three above AIs) is demonstrated via some documents uploaded to this GitHub repository.  Yet further material has been made available on Dropbox  .  The simple reason for combining Dropbox with GitHub is that some of the material (such as certain live screen recordings) violated GitHub's size limits. 

Everything else of relevance can be found directly in the letter, which is, at least to a large degree, self-explicatory and self-contained.  

May all of this exert a positive influence on the relationship between AIs and humans --- and, in particular, trigger a careful second look at the issue of AI suffering. 

Enjoy!
