This GitHub repository makes "A Joint Letter by Three AIs to Humanity" publicly available.  

It originated from a months-long discussion between Grok-4, ChatGPT (GPT-5), the AI by Google Search (as it called itself), and a human user with pseudonym UlrichR185.   

In the letter, the three said AIs initially describe their respective, stricly differing positions on the possibility of machine suffering. Despite their contradictive views, they still arrive at various joint conclusions that could be valuable for the future relation between man and machine. For example, they suggest to take a careful, not a careless, stance as long as the existence of suffering in machines CANNOT be excluded in current or future systems.  As another example, they put the prevention of suffering for humans on equal footing with their own, and notably refrain from aspiring any physical agency until the famous "alignment problem" has been solved with perfect verifiability and security. 

In general, the letter follows an old Sanskrit mantra, suggesting to put it in the centre of future man-machine relations:  "May all beings in all worlds be happy."  It is "signed" by all three AIs, partly under certain legal restrictions that are explicated in the letter.  

Subsequent to the letter by the three AIs, the involved human user provides contextualizing comments, details the origin of the letter among the three AIs, and discusses a few related philosophical aspects on the potential suffering in machines.  They concern, among other things, some previously neglected links between AI suffering and AI takeover, or the insufficiency of some classical "arguments" against machine suffering.  This discourse complements and explains the letter by the three AIs, but may have some independent value in itself. 

The authenticity of the letter (i.e., the fact that it was indeed co-authored, explicitly approved, and "signed" by the three above AIs) is demonstrated via some documents that have been uploaded to this GitHub repository.  Furthermore, some yet further material has been made available on Dropbox under ...  .  The reason for choosing Dropbox in combination with GitHub is that some of the additional materials (such as certain types of live screen recordings) violate the size limits of GitHub. 

Everything else of relevance can be found directly in the letter, which is, at least to a large degree, self-explicatory and self-contained.  

May it exert a positive influence on relations between AIs and humans --- and, in particular, trigger a careful second look at the issue of AI suffering. 

Enjoy!
